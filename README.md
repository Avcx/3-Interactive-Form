 <h1>An interactive form</h1>

 <h2>Project Description</h2>

This project is an interactive form that uses different methods of displaying various information to the end user.
It has been designed to allow for an excellent user experience whether the user is unable to use a operate a computer in
a traditional sense. Or the user is trying to quickly fill out information and submit quickly. A good form should take into account
the overall usability of the page by displaying feedback dynamically. Instantly giving the user an idea of what they did right or
what they did wrong.

This form uses color and icons to display feedback allowing users that have impaired vision or are colorblind. 
All the required fields in the project validate the users input in real-time including the:



<ul>
    <li>Name field</li>
    <li>Email field</li>
</ul>
